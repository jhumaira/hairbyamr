      <p className="text-black mb-6 text-lg">
        Hair loss affects millions of men, often starting as early as their twenties. Many turn to transplants, hoping for a permanent solution—only to find themselves spending tens of thousands of dollars on multiple sessions with underwhelming results. Even after months of healing, the outcome is often sparse and disappointing.
      </p>
      <p className="text-black mb-6 text-lg">
        Others rely on temporary fixes like hair fibers. While convenient, they come with a daily dose of stress—messy application, poor water resistance, and the ever-present worry of sweat, rain, or even a hug.
      </p>
      <p className="text-black mb-6 text-lg">
        That’s why we created this system.
      </p>
      <p className="text-black mb-6 text-lg">
        Engineered for realism and comfort, our units are lightweight, natural-looking, and designed with purpose. Unlike many traditional options, our pieces are synthetic and halal-friendly—offering a solution that aligns with personal values and spiritual peace of mind.
      </p>
      <p className="text-black mb-6 text-lg">
        For many of our clients, the biggest transformation isn’t just visual. It’s the restored confidence, the freedom from daily worry, and the compliments from friends and strangers alike. That’s the real power of the system we’ve built.
